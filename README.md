## About this project
The objective of this project is to build *an online P2P chatting web application*. The name of the app is **Pappus**, which means the part of an individual floret, that surrounds the base of the corolla tube in flower in Asteraceae.

Actually, my original wish is to make an alternative of Discord, which will have better safety and privacy than Discord.

## Features I hope pappus to have:
 - **Focus on privacy**: everything except user matching server, and the message receiving server when the user is not online (These must also be customizable), is on users' browser.
 - **100% Encryption**: The connection between the users will be encrypted by using the Public-key Cryptography. The keys are generated on the users' browser. The only way of identification is the keys. No passwords.
 - **Everything encrypted**: Without the secret key that the user generated when creating the account, nothing can be checked.
 - **Nice functions and UI**: The UI must be beautiful; Using the app must be easy for everyone.
 - **Highly extensible**: The app must have a method to add extensions(Including extend the functions and UI, etc). This is the best feature I want!!!
 - **Totally open source**: All the servers, web apps, apis and extensions are open source. Everyone has the right to check the safety of all the apps. Everyone has the permission to make the web apps, servers, apis and extensions better.
